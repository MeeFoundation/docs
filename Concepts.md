# Concepts



#### Selfness vs. Whoness

The late [Kim Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)) in his [last public speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk) introduced two useful definitions:

- **Selfness**: The sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 
- **Whoness**: Who or what a person or thing is. A distinct impression of a single person or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes a person or thing from others. 

The following diagram illustrates these concepts and introduces the notion of context:

#### The Self and Contexts

The Mee privacy agent is a [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) of the user and represents both their selfness and whonesses.

The selfness of the user is represented by a data container called the *Self*. The contents of the Self are holistic and therefore quite sensitive. For this reason they would normally not be shared in a direct or comprehensive form with others. This Self abstraction is at the heart of what enables the Mee architecture to be a ""*meta*-identity system," as opposed to an identity system. The user's Self is the point of integration across contexts each of which may be from differing identity systems. 

Each context is represented by a *Context* data container. A directed *correlation* link points from the Self entity to the entity representing the self in each context. The only person who must know that in reality these contexts contain representations of the same self/user is *that* user. Each context may define its own identifier namespace, schemas, state management, communications protocols, UI, UX, etc. 

We can illustrate all of these concepts with a simple example. A user might have a gmail address, a Twitter handle, and in a game they play have the handle DevilSpawn666. Here's how this is represented:

### Privacy Agent

A privacy agent is an end-user app that, on behalf of the user collects, organizes, manages and shares their personal data with others. An agent can request access to portions of another user's data or, conversely, grant a request to portions of their own data. The agent provides a user interface to support these functions but the data being accessed may or not be co-located on the same device or computer. Here is an overview of the main agent functions:

- Authenticate the user (e.g. via facial recognition, etc.)
- Allow the user to review, and in some cases edit, their personal data
- Request access to data from another person or grant/authorize a request from another person to data
- Manage the storage (including backup and recovery) of the user's data and replicate it across the user's devices

### Architecture

The Mee architecture supports the privacy agent and its interactions with third-party apps and websites. The top, Apps, layer includes both the agent itself as well as local and remote apps and websites that the user, shown below as "Alice" interacts with. The authorization layer handles requests for access to data. Alice's agent, local apps and other user's privacy agents. The replication layer implements a resource server that is supported by one or more data stores containing replicas of the users data on their variouls devices and web services.

### Framework classes

#### Sample Data

[framework.json](framework.json)

### Data Types

![framework-datatypes](./images/framework-datatypes.png)

- **ContextID** - The digital space/realm/domain within which the user is interacting. It may contain Digital Subjects other than the user
- **AppID** - The app that created and manages the contents of a ContextContainer

- **Secret Recovery Phrase** - a 12-word textual phrase that the user creates. It is used to generate cryptographic keys that in turn are used to encrypt the user’s personal data whether it is stored locally on their device or in a backup location. It can be used to generate keys to digitally sign transactions (e.g., for crypto currency transactions). It should never be shared with anyone or any service provider. If the user loses this phrase, they lose the ability to decrypt their data. 

##### Keys

* **Account key pair** is the primary user account key pair.
* **PBKDF2 key** is a key generated by using user password. It’s needed to encrypt the user account private key.
* **User device key pair** is a key pair is generated and stored on the user device. Device private key can be used to encrypt the user account private key.
* **Client key pair** is key pair to identify client app or website
* **Context key** is a key to encrypt user data in the context.

### Personal data
