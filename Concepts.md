# Concepts



#### Selfness vs. Whoness

The late [Kim Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)) in his [last public speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk) introduced two useful definitions:

- **Selfness**: The sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 
- **Whoness**: Who or what a person or thing is. A distinct impression of a single person or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes a person or thing from others. 

The following diagram illustrates these concepts and introduces the notion of context:

#### The Self and Contexts

The Mee framework is a [digital twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin) of the user and represents both their selfness and whonesses.

The selfness of the user is represented by a data container called the *Self*. The contents of the Self are holistic and therefore quite sensitive. For this reason they would normally not be shared in a direct or comprehensive form with others. This Self abstraction is at the heart of what enables the Mee Framework be what is called a ""*meta*-identity system," as opposed to an identity system. The user's Self is the point of integration across contexts each of which may be from differing identity systems. 

Each context is represented by a *Context* data container. A directed *correlation* link points from the Self entity to the entity representing the self in each context. The only person who must know that in reality these contexts contain representations of the same self/user is *that* user. Each context may define its own identifier namespace, schemas, state management, communications protocols, UI, UX, etc. 

We can illustrate all of these concepts with a simple example. A user might have a gmail address, a Twitter handle, and in a game they play have the handle DevilSpawn666. Here's how this is represented:

### Mee Framework

The Mee framework supports the Mee App as well as 3rd party apps. The heart of the framework is the Resource Server which is a database of the user's personal data, often called a personal datastore. The user is represented as entities (see blue circles below) within mulitple contexts linked to the Self. A context represents the user's interaction in some computer mediated realm with one or more other parties. Authorization of access to the Resource Server is controlled by the GNAP Authorization Server.

### Data Model

![framework-classes](framework-classes.png)

#### Sample Data

[framework.json](framework.json)

#### Data Types

- **Seed Phrase** - a 12-word textual phrase that the user creates. It is used to generate cryptographic keys that in turn are used to encrypt the user’s personal data whether it is stored locally on their device or in a backup location. It can be used to generate keys to digitally sign transactions (e.g., for crypto currency transactions). It should never be shared with anyone or any service provider. If the user loses this phrase, they lose the ability to decrypt their data. 

##### Keys

* **Account key pair** is the primary user account key pair.
* **PBKDF2 key** is a key generated by using user password. It’s needed to encrypt the user account private key.
* **User device key pair** is a key pair is generated and stored on the user device. Device private key can be used to encrypt the user account private key.
* **Client key pair** is key pair to identify client app or website
* **Context key** is a key to encrypt user data in the context.

### Rings

The Mee framework can be drawn as three concentric rings containing PDS, PDS “contexts”, and apps that hold the user’s personal data.

* **Ring 0:** The most sensitive information about a user consists of the linkages between the user and their multiple partial digital identities across different interaction contexts. This linkage information is stored in the innermost ring, ring 0 in what’s called the “root context” within the personal data store itself.
* **Ring 1** contains highly trusted apps that comply with the Ring 1 agreement. They read/write data from/to “context” containers managed by the PDS.
* **Ring 2** contains less trusted apps that comply with the Ring 2 agreement. They store copies of the user’s personal information and synchronize these copies with the copy in the user’s personal data store.

### Personal data

* [User-exclusive Data article](https://medium.com/meefound/exclusive-self-ownership-9917cb6bdd8c) - introduction to exclusive-to-the-user data
* [Categories of personal data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11F-V793seAon7xqFX2HEqeFhHvxttEUMkKSOrbM0ptc/edit#gid=0) - examples of user-exclusive and app-managed data
* Location/sharing alternatives:

### Data Sharing Agreements

Developers of Mee-compatible mobile apps and websites may choose to sign an agreement that includes limits on what they may do with the user’s data:

* *Ring 1 agreement:* compels the firm’s app(s) to not store copies of user-owned data nor sharing any user  user’s data with any other entity. [user benefits: privacy and control]
* *Ring 2 agreement:* a weaker agreement than above that allows the firm’s app(s) to store copies of user data, such that the latest values of app-asserted attributes about the user are always written to the user’s personal data store and the user may choose to update the app’s copy with the latest user-asserted attributes from the user’s personal data store. [user benefits: control]

If they agree to neither of the above then the user gains no additional guarantees WRT data handling beyond what existing laws provide.
