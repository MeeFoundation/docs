| AS A/AN  | I WANT TO…                                                   | SO THAT…                                                     |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **user** | have my personal data to be under my control as much as possible | I can decide what to share with whom                         |
| **user** | disclose my data to others (people and apps)                 | I can interact with them                                     |
| **user** | be able to trust thatwhat I disclose to others (people and apps) will be treated in confidence | my data is not sold to others                                |
| **user** | be able to trust thatwhat I disclose to others (people and apps) will be treated in confidence | my data if shared with data processors is held to the same terms as the original recipient |
| **user** | run the Mee app on mobile and desktop devices                | I can access it from any of my devices                       |
| **user** | have my data replicated/synced on all my devices             | I can decide at any time which device to use and have consistent results |
| **user** | be able to recover my Mee app data from catastrophic disaster where I loose all of my devices (and I loose access to my device backups) | I don't loose all of the personal data that I've already collected and the investment I've made in assembling it |
| **user** | have identifiers be unique within specific contexts, but not to have any root level identifiers (i.e. identifier attributes of the entity representing me in the root context) | my privacy is preserved since people can't correlate my identifiers across contexts |
