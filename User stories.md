### Privacy and disclosure

| AS A/AN  | I WANT TO…                                                   | SO THAT…                                                     |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **user** | my personal identity/data management app (the Mee app) is not dependent on any external administrative authority | I have self-sovereignty                                      |
| **user** | have un-correlated interactions with others over unbounded time and space | I have strong privacy                                        |
| **user** | have as much of my data as possible be *user-held*           | I can easily and directly disclose it to whomever I wish     |
| **user** | disclose my data to others (people and apps)                 | I can interact with them                                     |
| **user** | be able to trust the recipients of my disclosures            | I feel comfortable disclosing information to them            |
| **user** | be able to trust that what I disclose to others (people and apps) will not be disclosed by them to 3rd parties beyond the minimal amount necessary to implement the interaction/transaction with me | my data doesn't spread further than necessary to other actors and increase my vulnerability to exploitation |
| **user** | be able to know how the recipient of my disclosure will handle my personal data | I feel comfortable disclosing information to them            |

### Data management 

| AS A/AN  | I WANT TO…                                                   | SO THAT…                                                     |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **user** | run the Mee app on mobile and desktop devices                | I can access it from any of my devices                       |
| **user** | have my data replicated/synced on all my devices             | I can decide at any time which device to use and have a consistent user experience |
| **user** | be able to recover my Mee app data from catastrophic disaster where I loose all of my devices (and I loose access to my device backups) | I don't loose all of the personal data that I've already collected and the investment I've made in assembling it |
