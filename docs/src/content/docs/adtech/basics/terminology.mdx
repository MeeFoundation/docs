## Ad Profile Aggregator

A service used by one or more [service providers](#service-provider) on the [Mee Data Network](#mee-data-network). The [ad profile aggregator](#ad-profile-aggregator) combines raw user attribute data collected by these [service providers](#service-provider), anonymizes it, and uses it to infer a [personal ad profile](#personal-ad-profile) that is transmitted to and stored in the [ad profile service](#ad-profile-service). An [ad profile aggregator](#ad-profile-aggregator) doesn't persist user data although in performance-critical scenarios it cache temporary.

## Ad Profile Service

A service that stores [personal ad profiles](#personal-ad-profile). These profiles are never shared/sold with any other entity. The [ad profile service's](#ad-profile-service) database of profiles can be queried by advertisers to return the number of matching (non-identified) profiles within a defined [target audience profile](target-audience-profile). The ad profiles stored in this service sourced from [ad profile aggregators](#ad-profile-aggregator) and from profiles generated by the user's Mee Browser Extension.

## Personal Ad Profile

Data describing the interests and demographics of a Mee [identity agent](#identity-agent) user. This data is generated by an [ad profile agent](#ad-profile-agent) and managed by an [ad profile service](#ad-profile-service).

## Target Audience

A cohort of Mee users to which an advertiser would like to advertise.
