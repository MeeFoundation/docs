## Ad Profile Aggregator

A service used by one or more [service providers](#service-provider) on the [Mee Data Network](#mee-data-network). The [ad profile aggregator](#ad-profile-aggregator) combines raw user attribute data collected by these [service providers](#service-provider), anonymizes it, and uses it to infer a [Personal Ad Profile](#personal-ad-profile) that is transmitted to and stored in the [Ad Profile Service](#ad-profile-service). An [Ad Profile Aggregator](#ad-profile-aggregator) doesn't persist user data although in performance-critical scenarios it cache temporary.

## Ad Profile Service

A service that manages [personal ad profiles](#personal-ad-profile), requesting the matching (with [target audience profile](#target-audience-profile)) ones from [ad profile aggregator](#ad-profile-aggregator). These profiles are never shared/sold with any other entity. The [ad profile service's](#ad-profile-service) database of profiles can be queried by advertisers to return the number of matching (non-identified) profiles within a defined [target audience profile](target-audience-profile). 

## Personal Ad Profile

Data describing the interests and demographics of a Mee [identity agent](#identity-agent) user. This data is generated by an [ad profile agent](#ad-profile-agent) and managed by an [ad profile service](#ad-profile-service).

## Target Audience Profile

A cohort of Mee users to which an advertiser would like to advertise.
