#### App

A website, web service, or app (or the *smartwallet* of another *holder*) that communicates with the *holder's* *smartwallet*.

#### Claim

An assertion made about a *subject* in a *context*.

#### Connection

A relationship between a *smartwallet* (acting on behalf of its *holder*) and an *other* which is represented by an *app* or another *smartwallet*. A *connection*'s state is stored by one or more *contexts*. 

#### Connector

Code that implements one aspect of a *connection*. This code implements a Connector interface/abstraction at the core of the smartwallet. It is associated with a single *context*. It may receive data from the *app* and store it in this *context*, and/or it may read data from the *context* and transmit it to the *app*.

#### Context

A container of data that holds the state for one aspect of a *connection*. The *container* contains a *person* entity that represents the *holder* along with a set of *claims* about them. It may also contain entities representing other *subjects* along with their *claims*.

### Digital Wallet

A *digital wallet* is a software program or web service that securely stores and conveniently organizes a person's payment methods, boarding passes, event tickets in one place. Recently the definition has expanded to include digital credentials like driver's licenses, passports, and certifications usually packaged as Verifiable Credentials that can be issued to the wallet by an issuer and presented from the wallet to a verifier. 

#### Holder

The *person* that has installed and uses the *smartwallet* on one or more of their devices (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop, home server, etc.).

#### Human Information License

A data sharing contract between the business providing the *app* and The Mee Foundation (or delegate), acting on the *holder's* behalf. This contract licenses the *holder's* information under specific terms. The business or other kind of organization (i) must not collect, use, retain, or share the *holderâ€™s* information with any other party without consent, and (ii) must implement APIs that enable the *holder's* *smartwallet* to remotely control their data.

#### Mee-certified

An *app* offered by an online service provider business (or other kind of organization) (aka the relying party), that is interoperable with the *smartwallet*. In addition, the Mee *holder's* information involved in a data sharing connection with this *app* is subject to the terms of a valid *human information license* agreement.

#### Mee-compatible

An *app* offered by an online service provider business (or other kind of organization) (aka the relying party) that is interoperable with the *smartwallet*. That is, there is at least one protocol that both can speak.

#### Other

A kind of *subject* that is the other party in a direct communication between the *smartwallet* and the *app* that is this other party. Following convention we sometimes refer to this as the relying party (RP), although this term implies an asymmetry that doesn't exist in peer-to-peer interactions between two people.

#### Smartwallet

A *smartwallet* extends the concept of a *digital wallet*: 
- It adds dynamic data sharing *connections* to other parties wherein information can be updated over time. This information can flow periodically or continuously from an external party to the wallet, in the reverse direction, or in both directions
- It allows the holder to license their information to relying parties (RP) (e.g. external apps/sites) under the terms of a data sharing agreement, thereby allowing the holder to retain significant control over their information after it has been shared with the RP
- It provides privacy protection for the *holder* (e.g. implementing https://globalprivacycontrol.org)
- It supports wallet-to-wallet messaging using very limited or no reliance on intermediary cloud-based services
- The entire state of a *logical* wallet may be replicated (i.e. copied and synchronized) across multiple *physical* replicas. The allows the holder to use a single logical wallet on multiple devices they may have.
- Part of the state of a logical wallet may be replicated across multiple, *partial* physical wallets. Each partial wallet may contain as few as one *context* (along with its own *Self* replica).

#### Person

A *subject* that represents a natural person.

#### Protocol

A communication protocol used between the *smartwallet* and an *app*.

#### Self

A singleton data container holding a single *Person* entity that represents the *selfness* of the *person.*

#### Selfness

The sameness of a *person* or a thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a *person* or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 

#### Subject

A thing about which *claims* are made.

#### Whoness

Who or what a person or thing is. A distinct impression of a single person or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes a *person* or thing from others.
