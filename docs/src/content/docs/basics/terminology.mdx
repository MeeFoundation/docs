#### App

A website or a mobile app (often called a Relying Party) that communicates with the Mee smartwallet. 

#### Claim

An assertion made about a Subject. 

#### Connection

A relationship between the smartwallet user and an Other. It is represented by one or more other Contexts.

#### Context

A Context is a container of data about a connection that is written to or read from by an app, website or smartwallet. This data may have been input by the user, sensed by the site/app or generated by the site/app (see the Personal Data section for definitions of these categories). 

#### Holder

The person that has installed the smartwallet on one or more of their devices.

#### Mee-certified

An app or website offered by an online service provider (the relying party), that is interoperable with the Mee smartwallet. In addition, the Mee userâ€™s information involved in a data sharing connection to this relying party is subject to the terms of a valid Human Information License agreement (under development).

#### Mee-compatible

An app, website or smartwallet offered by another party that is interoperable with the Mee smartwallet. That is, there is at least one protocol that both can speak. We make one exception: form filling (and password managers that rely on form filling) don't count as a procotol for the purpose of this definition.

#### Other

A kind of Subject that is the other party in a direct communication between the smartwallet and the app (or smartwallet) that is this other party. Following popular convention we sometimes call this the Relying Party (RP) although this term implies a lack of symmetry that doesn't exist in peer-to-peer interactions between two people.

#### Smartwallet

A software app installed on the user's device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that interacts with Mee-compatible other party's apps, websites and/or smartwallets.

#### Person

A kind of Subject that represents a natural person.

#### Protocol
