#### App

A website, web service, or app (or the smartwallet of another holder) that communicates with the holder's smartwallet.

#### Claim

An assertion made about a *subject* in a *context*.

#### Connection

A relationship between a smartwallet (acting on behalf of its *holder*) and an *other* which is represented by an *app* or another smartwallet. A *connection*'s state is stored by one or more *contexts*. 

#### Connector

Code that implements one aspect of a *connection*. This code implements a Connector interface/abstraction at the core of the smartwallet. It is associated with a single *context*. It may receives data from the *app* and store it in this *context*, and/or it may read data from the *context* and transmit it to the *app*.

#### Context

A container of data that holds the state for one aspect of a *connection*. The *container* contains a *person* entity that represents the *holder* along with a set of *claims* about them. It may also contain entities representing other *subjects* along with their *claims*.

#### Holder

The *person* that has installed and uses the *smartwallet* on one or more of their devices (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop, home server, etc.).

#### Human Information License

A contract between the business providing the *app* and The Mee Foundation (or delegate), acting on the individual’s behalf. This contract licenses the holder's information under specific terms. The business (i) must not collect, use, retain, or share the person’s information with any other party without consent, and (ii) must implement data rights APIs that enable the *holder's* *smartwallet* to remotely control their data.

#### Mee-certified

An *app* offered by an online service provider business (or other kind of organization) (aka the relying party), that is interoperable with the *smartwallet*. In addition, the Mee holder's information involved in a data sharing connection with this relying party is subject to the terms of a valid *human information license* agreement..

#### Mee-compatible

An *app* offered by an online service provider business (or other kind of organization) (aka the relying party) that is interoperable with the *smartwallet*. That is, there is at least one protocol that both can speak.

#### Other

A kind of *subject* that is the other party in a direct communication between the smartwallet and the *app* that is this other party. Following convention we sometimes refer to this as the Relying Party (RP), although this term implies an asymmetry that doesn't exist in peer-to-peer interactions between two people.

#### Smartwallet

A software app installed on the person's device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that interacts with Mee-compatible other party's apps, websites and/or smartwallets.

#### Person

A subject that represents a natural person.

#### Protocol

A communication protocol used between the smartwallet and an endpoint provided by another party

#### Subject

A thing about which *claims* are made.
