#### App

A website, web service, or app (or the smartwallet of another holder) that communicates with the holder's smartwallet.

#### Claim

An assertion made about a *subject* in a *context*.

#### Connection

A relationship between a smartwallet (acting on behalf of its *holder*) and an *other* which is represented by an *app* or another smartwallet. A *connection*'s state is stored by one or more *contexts*. 

#### Connector

Code that implements one aspect of a connection. It does so by receiving data from an *app* and storing it in a *context*, or by reading data from the *context* and sending it to an *app*.

#### Context

A container of data that describes one aspect of a *connection*. The container contains an entity representing *holder* and a set of *claims* about them. It may also contain entities representing other *subjects*.

#### Holder

The *person* that has installed and uses the smartwallet on one or more of their devices (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop, home server, etc.).

#### Mee-certified

An app or website offered by an online service provider (the relying party), that is interoperable with the Mee smartwallet. In addition, the Mee userâ€™s information involved in a data sharing connection to this relying party is subject to the terms of a valid Human Information License agreement (under development).

#### Mee-compatible

An *app* offered by another party that is interoperable with the Mee smartwallet. That is, there is at least one protocol that both can speak. We make one exception: form filling (and password managers that rely on form filling) doesn't count as a procotol for the purpose of this definition.

#### Other

A kind of *subject* that is the other party in a direct communication between the smartwallet and the *app* that is this other party. Following popular convention we sometimes call this the Relying Party (RP) although this term implies a lack of symmetry that doesn't exist in peer-to-peer interactions between two people.

#### Smartwallet

A software app installed on the person's device (phone, tablet, laptop, etc.) that interacts with Mee-compatible other party's apps, websites and/or smartwallets.

#### Person

A subject that represents a natural person.

#### Protocol

A communication protocol used between the smartwallet and an endpoint provided by another party

#### Subject

A thing about which *claims* are made.
