# Terminology

This page is new, updated content that we will eventually publish to here (replacing that older content): https://docs-dev.mee.foundation/basics/terminology/


#### App

A website, web service, mobile, tablet, laptop or desktop app (or the *smartwallet* of another *holder*) that communicates with the *holder's* *smartwallet*.

#### Claim

An assertion made about a *subject* in a *context*.

#### Connection

A relationship between a *smartwallet* (acting on behalf of its *holder*) and an *other* which is represented by an *app* or another *smartwallet*. A *connection*'s state is stored by one or more *contexts*. 

#### Connector

Code that implements one aspect of a *connection*. This code implements a Connector interface/abstraction at the core of the smartwallet. It is associated with a single *context*. It may receive data from the *app* and store it in this *context*, and/or it may read data from the *context* and transmit it to the *app*.

#### Context

A container of data that holds the state for one aspect of a *connection*. The *container* contains an entity that represents the *holder* along with a set of *claims* about them. It may also contain entities representing other *subjects* along with their *claims*.

#### Digital Wallet

A *digital wallet* is a software program or web service that securely stores and conveniently organizes a person's payment methods, boarding passes, event tickets in one place. Recently the definition has expanded to include digital credentials like driver's licenses, passports, and certifications usually packaged as Verifiable Credentials that can be issued to the wallet by an issuer and presented from the wallet to a verifier. 

A *digital wallet* is comprised of two components an agent and an Self-Managed Personal Data Store (SMPD). The state of a *local wallet* is held in the SMPD. The agent is responsible for interacting with the outside world (e.g. data issuers and *relying parties*). The agent is an active component what works on behalf the holder and directly manages the contents of the SMPD.

##### Local Wallet

A *digital wallet* app that runs on the *holder's* local devices (e.g. smartphone, tablet, or laptop) either as a standalone app, a browser extension, or a combination of both. 

This state may be replicated (i.e. copied and synchronized) across multiple physical replicas with each replica running as its own application. For example a *holder* could have an iOS *wallet* whose AMPD state it replicated bidirectionally with their MacOS *wallet* app. This affords the *holder* the convenience of being able to pick up and use any of their *wallet* apps knowing that each has the same state (i.e. the same set of connections, etc.).

##### Cloud Wallet

A *digital wallet* that runs in the cloud (or is self-hosted). The AMPD state of a *cloud wallet* is also stored in the cloud.

##### Smartwallet

A *smartwallet* is a kind of *digital wallet:* It extends the wallet concept as follows:

- It adds dynamic data sharing *connections* to *relying parties* wherein information can be updated over time. This information can flow periodically or continuously from an external party to the wallet, in the reverse direction, or in both directions.
- It allows the holder to license their information to a *relying party's* app under the terms of a data sharing agreement, thereby allowing the holder to retain significant control over their information stored by the *relying party*.
- It supports smartwallet-to-smartwallet messaging using little or no reliance on intermediary cloud-based services.

Smartwallets may be *local wallets* (called *local smartwallets*) or *cloud wallets* (called *cloud smartwallets*). The Mee Foundation is developing local *smartwallets*.


#### Human Information License

A data sharing contract between the business providing the *app* and The Mee Foundation (or delegate), acting on the *holder's* behalf. This contract licenses the *holder's* information under specific terms. The business or other kind of organization (i) must not collect, use, retain, or share the *holderâ€™s* information with any other party without consent, and (ii) must implement APIs that enable the *holder's* *smartwallet* to remotely control their data.

#### Mee-certified

A *Mee-compatible* app wherein the *holder's* information that is involved in a data sharing connection with this *app* is subject to the terms of a valid *human information license* agreement.

#### Mee-compatible

An *app* offered by an online service provider business (or other kind of legal entity), the relying party, that is interoperable with the *smartwallet* using at least one protocol.

#### Personal Data Service

Shown below are various components with which a *personal data service*,  interacts. 

![def-components](/Users/paul/Documents/GitHub/docs/docs/src/content/docs/images/def-components.png)

##### Mee Web App

A deployment of a *personal data service* (under development) at https://itsmee.org. It is built using the Mee *personal data service.*

##### Personal Data Service (PDS)

A web service that manages the user's data in mulitple distributed Self-managed or Co-managed Personal Datastores.

If the user is the holder of a Local smartwallet, the PDS will synchronize personal data state with it. 

The PDS co-manages the personal data in a app provider's Co-managed Personal Datastore. We say co-manages because on a fine-grained attribute by attribute level access rights may be controlled by the PDS user, the provider, or a combination of the two. 

##### Provider local app

A single PDS may be linked to multiple provider's local apps. The personal data that has been shared with (or generated within) each provider's local *app* remains within that *app* and is not stored in the the web service. 

##### Provider web app

A single PDS may be linked to multiple provider's web apps. The personal data that has been shared with (or generated within) each provider's web *app* remains within that *app* and is not stored in the the web service. 

##### Co-managed Personal Datastore (CPD) SDK

This is an SDK that is a helper library to lower implementation costs by providers to make their stores of personal data compatible with the *personal data service*.

##### Co-managed Personal Datastore (CPD) Service

A multi-user cloud-based service component that a provider can choose to integrate into its own web app to allow it to interoperate with a *personal data service*.

#### Protocol

A communication protocol used between the *smartwallet* and an *app*.

#### Self

A singleton data container holding a single *person* entity that represents the *selfness* of the *person.*

#### Selfness

The sameness of a *person* or a thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a *person* or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 

#### Subject

A thing about which *claims* are made. 

![definitions-subject](/Users/paul/Documents/GitHub/docs/docs/src/content/docs/images/def-subject.png)

##### Corporation

A *subject that represents a for-profit or nonprofit legal entity.

##### Person

A *subject* that represents a natural person.

##### Holder

The *person* that has installed and uses the *smartwallet* on one or more of their devices (e.g. phone, tablet, laptop, home server, etc.).

##### Provider

The business entity (e.g. corporation) that provides an app for its users. 

##### Relying Party (RP)

![def-relying-party](/Users/paul/Documents/GitHub/docs/docs/src/content/docs/images/def-relying-party.png)A *subject* with which the holder interacts. An *RP* may be another *holder* or a *provider*.

For example, in a *connection* between the *holder's* *smartwallet* and a typical *app*, the *relying party* is the *provider* that offers the *app*. If the *app* is another *holder's* *smartwallet*, the *relying party* is this other *holder*.


#### Whoness

A distinct impression of a single *person* or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes one *person* or thing from other people or things.
