description: Getting Started with Mee Smartwallet
---

We're about giving people control of their own personal data by developing the Mee Smartwallet and fostering a community of compatible digital service providers.

### Protects your privacy
* Tells apps/sites “Do Not Track” and “Do Not Sell My Personal Information”
* Works automatically behind the scenes

### Manages your stuff
* Retrieves your data from apps/sites you use
* Organizes it conveniently across all of your apps/sites
* Stores your data on your device (nothing is shared with The Mee Foundation)

### Represents you online
* No more passwords–you’re logged in immediately
* No more creating accounts and filling in forms
* Private sharing: tap the Continue-with-Mee button on apps/sites to create a data private data sharing connection [under development]
* Share privacy-protected advertising interest profiles  to increase relevance of content and offers [under development]

## For Providers
If you're a service provider and would like to learn how to make your app/site compatible then have a look at [Connect with Mee](/integration/connect-with-mee).

Mee is a work in progress; the future directions and milestones are described in our [Roadmap](/contributing/roadmap). The [Releases](/releases) page lists the deliverables available right now. Here is some of the [Terminology](/basics/terminology) we use.
