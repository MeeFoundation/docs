# Concepts



### Selfness vs. Whoness

In his [last public speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DExNTY3QAk) [Kim Cameron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Cameron_(computer_scientist)) introduced two useful definitions based on archaic English:

- **Selfness**: The sameness of a person or thing at all times or in all circumstances. The condition of being a single individual. The fact that a person or thing is itself and not something else. Individuality, personality. 
- **Whoness**: Who or what a person or thing is. A distinct impression of a single person or thing presented to or perceived by others. A set of characteristics or a description that distinguishes a person or thing from others. 

The following diagram illustrates these concepts and introduces the notion of context:

### Contexts and Connections

An individual has relationships with other parties (the Relying Parties, or RPs). These relationships when captured digitally and managed by an identity agent are called Connections. Within a Connection are one ore more Contexts. A context is a container of information about that Connection that is written to by the app or agent that is intermediating it's aspect of the connection. In the case of the user building a connection between their identity agent and an RP that is a digital service provider, the user's agent is talking with the provider's website or app. In this case if this RP's site/app is Mee-compatible, then this site/app writes personal data related to this connection to a Context container. This data may have been input by the user, sensed by the site/app or generated by the site/app (see the Personal Data section for definitions of these categories). 

There may also be other site/apps involved in the same user-to-RP connection and each site/app writes to a separate context associated with the same connection. For example, a password manager app may also be involved in mediating the user's relationship with the same RP. In this case the password manager writes its data (e.g. username, password, etc.) to its own context associated with the same connection.

### Personal data

* [User-exclusive Data article](https://medium.com/meefound/exclusive-self-ownership-9917cb6bdd8c) - introduction to exclusive-to-the-user data
* [Categories of personal data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11F-V793seAon7xqFX2HEqeFhHvxttEUMkKSOrbM0ptc/edit#gid=477806070) - four main categories of user data (user input, app sensed, app generated and app inferred) and how examples of these categories are managed in different ways (user-exclusive, user-shared, user-replicated, app-shared, app-replicated or app-shared)
* Location/sharing alternatives:

### Mee-compatible apps

The apps or websites offered by service providers that are interoperable with the Mee agent software. Note: the Mee user’s information involved in data sharing connections is not subject to the terms of a valid Human Information License agreement.

### Mee-certified apps

The apps or websites offered by service providers that are interoperable with the Mee agent software. In addition, the Mee user’s information involved in data sharing connections is subject to the terms of a valid Human Information License agreement.
