### Roadmap

**v0.1 - Nov-14 hard-coded IIW35 Demo (iOS only)** 

* Login with Connect-with-Mee (iOS mobile app/browser only) + NYT mobile app? 
* Recognize user (e.g. using facial recognition, etc.)
* SIOP?  -> Sasha will work on the interfaces and helper method that will allow us to integrate the demo shown in the call; support SIOP in 2-3 weeks before the demo. Username -> SIOP discovery -> return info about Mee auth endpoint and RP will use this auth endpoint to use Mee to auth user account. Domain (meeproject.org) is the endpoint to make a discovery request. Possibly to find 3d party RP to prove that it works properly.
