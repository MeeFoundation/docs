# Use cases

This page is a collection of potentially interesting agent use cases. They apply to the agent irrespective of the platform (e.g. mobile phone or desktop) it is running on. Please note that for brevity we write "user", rather than "agent  user".

## Intrinsic

These use cases would be supported natively by the agent app and its associated browser extension.

### P2P Messaging

Allows the user to chat with other agent users. 

### Global Privacy Control

Allows the agent user to automatically signal their intent that website should not sell my data to third-parties using the https://globalprivacycontrol.org standard. 

### Third-party Cookies

Allows the user to choose to automatically delete third-party cookies from the user's browser. Requires Mee Browser Extension (MBX).

### Browser Privacy Assistant

Looks at the user's browser settings (e.g. Google location tracking, history), makes recommendations on settings changes to enhance privacy and implements these changes. 

### Digital Wallet

Credit/Debit Card

Tickets/Boarding Passes

Travel/Loyalty Cards 

Cryptocurrency/NFTs

Driver's Licenses

Digital ID Cards

Digital Car and Room Keys

PassKeys

#### Password Manager

Allows the user to:

- Create and manage strong passwords
- Autofill passwords on any browser
- Sync passwords across their devices
- Grant/delegate access to other agent users to some/all passwords
- Remembers and highlights the last login method used on a given site. 

### Form Filler

Allows the user to automatically fill in forms in browsers using data managed by the agent across the user's devices. 

### Private Advertising

The agent automatically and continuously updates the user's Customer Defined Audience (CDA) advertising profile. The user can view it and delete fields of not interest. This CDA profile can be shared with compatible websites to enable them to earn revenues from advertising while increasing the user's privacy compared to existing solutions that rely on third-party cookies and other forms of tracking and that rely on massive databases of user advertising profiles assemble and managed by third-party adtech firms. 

### Browser History

Allows the user's web browsing history (outside of Incognito mode) to be collected in the agent. Requires MBX.

### Search History

Allows the user's search history (outside of Incognito mode) to be collected in the agent. Requres MBX.

## Extrinsic

These use cases would be supported by an external local app or site.

### Auto-updating Contacts

Allows the user to stay in contact with friends, family and colleagues by everyone always having up-to-date contact information. Allows the user to:

- Populates their own contact info (either directly, or through integration with the user's existing contact management app/service (see below))
- Publish their contact information as part of a connection to an other user's agent
- Subscribe to the contact info of another user
- Integrates with existing contact management apps and services, allowing the user to continue using them, with the syncing happending in the background. For example the user could continue to use Apple's Contacts app on their Macbook or iPhone - contact info of other's that the user is subscribing to are automatically updated and any change made to the user's contact information is automatically propagated to subscribers.

### Delete My Data

Allows the user to exercise their rights and request that their data be deleted by digital service providers. Similar to https://www.permissionslipcr.com/.  

### Meta-Identity Management

#### Meta-Social Networking

Looks at how the user is connected to other people across social networks and suggests missing links. For example if noticed that the user has contact information for a person but isn't linked to them on LinkedIn, it suggests (and could automate) adding this parallel connection.
