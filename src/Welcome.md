# Welcome to Mee!

We're about giving people control of their own personal data by developing the Mee identity agent and fostering a community of compatible digital service providers.

If you're a service provider and would like to learn how to make your app/site compatible then have a look at [Connect with Mee](./Connect_with_Mee.md).

Mee is a work in progress; the future directions and milestones are described in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md). The [Releases](./Releases.md) page lists the deliverables available right now. Here is some of the [Terminology](Terminology.md) we use.
