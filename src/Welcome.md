# Welcome to Mee

We're passionately committed giving people control of their own personal data by fostering a community of Mee-compatible digital service providers. Central to this is the development of a [identity agent](Mee_agent.md) app that runs on your own devices, represents you and protects your interests online. This agent in combination with new law will enable users to enter into high-trust, private data sharing relationships with service providers (e.g., apps, websites, etc.). 

The [Architecture](Architecture.md) page gives a larger picture of how this agent interoperates with the world. The data model used by Mee is described on the [Data](Data.md) page. You may also find helpful the [Concepts page](Concepts.md) that contains the definitions of the concepts used throughout this documentation.

Mee is a work in progress; the future directions and milestones are available [here](Roadmap.md). Finally, the [Products](Products.md) page lists the deliverables available at the moment.
