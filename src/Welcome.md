# Welcome to Mee

The goal of Mee is to bring your data back to you. 

Our mission is to enable human-centered, high-trust, private relationships between internet users and service providers (e.g., apps, websites, etc.). The Mee Project is developing the governance and decentralized, human-centered software technology necessary to support these relationships.
