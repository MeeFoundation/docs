# Welcome to Mee

Central to our mission is the development of a [Mee identity agent](Mee_agent.md) app that represents users and protects their interests online. This agent will enable users to enter into high-trust, private data sharing relationships with service providers (e.g., apps, websites, etc.). 

The [Architecture](Architecture.md) gives a larger picture of how this agent interoperates with the world. The detailed data model used by Mee is described on the [Data](Data.md) page. You may also find helpful the [Concepts page](Concepts.md) that contains the definitions of the concepts used throughout this documentation.

Mee is a work in progress; the future directions and milestones are available [here](Roadmap.md). Finally, the [Products](Products.md) page lists the deliverables available at the moment.
