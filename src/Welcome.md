# Welcome to Mee!

We're about giving people control of their own personal data by fostering a community of Mee-compatible digital service providers and by developing the Mee identity agent. 

If you're a service provider and would like to learn how to make your website or app Mee-compatible these sections will be of most interest:

- [Connect with Mee](./Connect_with_Mee.md)

If you'd like to learn about, or contribute to, the development of the Mee identity agent, the following sections are most relevant:

-  [Identity agent](./Identity_agent.md) - an app that offers privacy and convenience by giving the user more control over their own personal information as they interact with websites, mobile apps, and other user's agents.
- [Architecture](Architecture.md) - a larger picture of how this agent interoperates with relying parties.
- [Data model](Data_model.md) - describes the agent's data model 

You may also find the [Concepts](Concepts.md) page helpful; it contains  definitions of the concepts and terminology used throughout this documentation.

Mee is a work in progress; the future directions and milestones are available [here](Roadmap.md). Finally, the [Releases](./Releases.md) page lists the deliverables available at the moment.
