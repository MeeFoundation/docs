# Welcome to Mee

The goal of Mee is to bring your data back to you. 

Our mission is to enable human-centered, high-trust, private relationships between internet users and service providers (e.g., apps, websites, etc.). The Mee Project is developing the governance and decentralized, human-centered software technology necessary to support these relationships.

The core part of Mee is the [Privacy Agent](Privacy_agent.md). The [Architecture](Architecture.md) gives a larger picture of how the Privacy Agent interoperates with the world. The detailed data model used by Mee is described on the [Data](Data.md) page. You may also find helpful the [vocabulary](Concepts.md) that contains the definitions of the concepts used throughout this documentation.

Mee is by no means done; the future directions and milestones are available [here](Roadmap.md). Finally, the [Products](Products.md) page lists the deliverables available at the moment.
